PyTorch/2.2.2-rocm-5.6.1-python-3.10-singularity-20240617:
   Though this container is based on a version of ROCm that is officially
   supported by the ROCm driver on the system, we cannot exclude that there
   will be problems when, e.g., the container integrates with the Cray PE as
   it may be trying to link to libraries that were meant to be used with a
   different version of ROCm. In particular, we expect that mpi4py may
   produce warnings.

/opt/miniconda3/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/distributed/launch.py:183: FutureWarning: The module torch.distributed.launch is deprecated
and will be removed in future. Use torchrun.
Note that --use-env is set by default in torchrun.
If your script expects `--local-rank` argument to be set, please
change it to read from `os.environ['LOCAL_RANK']` instead. See
